# pings-tanda-nodeJS

Implementation of Tanda's back-end engineering challenge with nodeJS, using express and sqlite3. NPM must be used to install node module dependancies from the package.json file; this can be done with the command 'npm install'.

Once server is running on port 3000 using npm, simply run pings.rb to test.
